        <p><em><strong>Personal Support Worker</strong> (NOC 4412)</em></p>
        <p>Hello! My name is Volodymyr and I am a doctor with three years of experience! At the moment I work as a specialist in the sale of medicines, but I really want to return to work by vocation, namely I want to help people and take care of
          them! In
          the past, as a district doctor, I cared for the health of more than 2,000 patients, most of whom were retired. I get along well with people, I can listen and respect old age, I learn quickly and I do not shy away from work. In addition, I
          am
          physically strong, have good driving experience and are ready to move to another country.</p>
